Remove support for Python < 3.6: 

Update setup.py to state a minimum Python version of 3.6 (example from Sygnal). 
Update pyproject.toml to state a target Python version for Black (example from Synapse).
Remove all mention and use of six, as we no longer support Python 2.
Remove all # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- lines from files; Python 3 is UTF-8 by default.
Run pyupgrade on Sydent with arguments --py36-plus --keep-percent-format.
