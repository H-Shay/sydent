Hello,

In the past, identity services did not take case into account when creating and storing
mxids. This led to your email address, %(to)s being stored with two mxids. A recent update
changed this behavior and streamlined the mxids associated with your email address.
This is a notification to let you know that matrix id %(mxid)s has been deleted in accordance
with this update.
